# Shark Identification and Classification for Conservation

Our App is available here: https://shark-id.streamlit.app/

This work is part of LeWagon's project weeks - Data Science batch #1271.

## Project overview ðŸš€
The aim of this project was to develop an app that could accurately identify the species of a shark by analyzing an input image. To accomplish this, we utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that was trained on the Kaggle Shark Species Dataset. Once the network had undergone training, we packaged it into a Docker container for deployment as a web application through Google Cloud Run. The end result is a user-friendly app that can swiftly determine the shark species from a given image.

This github contains the Streamlit-based web interface files for the app.
